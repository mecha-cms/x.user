### File

All you need to do after installing this extension is to create a page file in the `.\lot\user` folder. Name the page
after the user name you want. For example, here I will create a user with the name `@‌john-doe`:

~~~ .txt
.\
└── lot\
    └── user\
        └── john-doe.page ✔
~~~

And this will be what it contains:

~~~ .yaml
---
author: John Doe
type: Markdown
status: 1
...

I am the main author of [this site](http://127.0.0.1).
~~~

### Page

The user’s profile page can be accessed through the `http://127.0.0.1/user/john-doe` link. To go to the log-in page,
remove the user name from the link:

~~~ .txt
http://127.0.0.1/user
~~~

Please note that if the `.\lot\user\john-doe\pass.data` file does not exist, the password field will work as a password
generator. You can enter any password and `pass.data` file will be created automatically. This is how you would reset a
user password. Simply delete the `pass.data` file.

### Result

#### Without User Extension

The page in `.\lot\page\lorem-ipsum.page`:

~~~ .yaml
---
title: Page Title
author: John Doe
...

Page content.
~~~

To get the author data:

~~~ .php
<?= $page->author; ?>
~~~

#### With User Extension

The page in `.\lot\page\lorem-ipsum.page`:

~~~ .yaml
---
title: Page Title
author: '@‌john-doe'
...

Page content.
~~~

The user file in `.\lot\user\john-doe.page`:

~~~ .yaml
---
author: John Doe
link: 'http://example.com'
...

Page content.
~~~

To get the author data:

~~~ .html.php
<a href="<?= $page->author->link; ?>">
  <?= $page->author; ?>
</a>
~~~

Or:

~~~ .php
<?= $page->author; ?>
