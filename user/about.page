  '.\lot\x\page': 1
...

### File

All you have to do after installing this extension is to create a page file in the `.\lot\user` folder. Name the page according to the user name you want. For example, here I will create user data with the name `@‌ta-tau-taufik`:

~~~ .txt
.\
└── lot\
    └── user\
        └── ta-tau-taufik.page
~~~

And the following is the content of the file:

~~~ .yaml
---

...

I am the main author of [this site](http://127.0.0.1).
~~~

### Page

User profile page can be accessed via the `http://127.0.0.1/user/ta-tau-taufik` link. To go to the log in page, remove the user name from the link:

~~~ .txt
http://127.0.0.1/user
~~~

> **Note:** If `.\lot\user\ta-tau-taufik\pass.data` file does not exist, then the password field will function as a password generator. You can type any password in it and `pass.data` file will be created automatically.

### Result

#### Without User Extension

The page in `.\lot\page\lorem-ipsum.page`:

~~~ .yaml
---
title: Page Title
author: Taufik Nurrohman
...

Page content.
~~~

To get the author data:

~~~ .php
<?= $page->author; ?>
~~~

#### With User Extension

The page in `.\lot\page\lorem-ipsum.page`:

~~~ .yaml
---
title: Page Title
author: '@‌ta-tau-taufik'
...

Page content.
~~~

The user file in `.\lot\user\ta-tau-taufik.page`:

~~~ .yaml
---
author: Taufik Nurrohman
link: 'http://example.com'
...

Page content.
~~~

To get the author data:

~~~ .html
<a href="<?= $page->author->link; ?>">
  <?= $page->author; ?>
</a>
~~~

Or:

~~~ .php
<?= $page->author; ?>
~~~
