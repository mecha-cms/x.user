### File

All you have to do after installing this extension is to create a page file in the `.\lot\user` folder. Name the page according to the user name you want. For example, here I will create user data with the name `@‌ta-tau-taufik`:

~~~ .txt
.\
 └── lot\
     └── user\
         └── ta-tau-taufik.page
~~~

And the following is the content of the file:

~~~ .yaml
---
'$': Taufik Nurrohman
type: Markdown
status: 1
...

I am the main author of [this site](http://127.0.0.1).
~~~

### Page

User profile page can be accessed via the `http://127.0.0.1/user/ta-tau-taufik` link. To go to the log in page, remove the user name from the link:

~~~ .txt
http://127.0.0.1/user
~~~

> **Note:** If `.\lot\user\ta-tau-taufik\pass.data` file does not exist, then the password field will function as a password generator. You can type any password in it and `pass.data` file will be created automatically.

### Constant

This extension will add a folder called `user` in the `.\lot` folder, which will also automatically add a constant named `USER`.

~~~ .php
USER
~~~

### Method

There are some methods added to the default classes:

#### Is → User

~~~ .xmp.php
Is::user($key = null, $fail = false);
~~~

**Example:**

Check whether a user is logged in:

~~~ .php
if (Is::user()) { … }
~~~

Check whether user `@‌ta-tau-taufik` is logged in:

~~~ .php
if (Is::user('ta-tau-taufik')) { … }
~~~

#### Get → Users

~~~ .xmp.php
Get::users($folder = USER, …, $sort = [1, 'slug'], …);
~~~

Function arguments are the same as function `Get::pages()`, except the `$folder` parameter that uses `USER` constant value by default, and the `$sort` parameter that uses `slug` as the default sort key instead of `time`.

### Result

#### Without User Extension

The page in `.\lot\page\test-page.page`:

~~~ .yaml
---
title: Page Title
author: Taufik Nurrohman
...

Page content.
~~~

To get the author data:

~~~ .php
<?php echo $page->author; ?>
~~~

#### With User Extension

The page in `.\lot\page\test-page.page`:

~~~ .yaml
---
title: Page Title
author: '@‌ta-tau-taufik'
...

Page content.
~~~

The user file in `.\lot\user\ta-tau-taufik.page`:

~~~ .yaml
---
'$': Taufik Nurrohman
link: 'http://example.com'
...

Page content.
~~~

To get the author data:

~~~ .html
<a href="<?php echo $page->author->link; ?>" id="<?php echo $page->author->key; ?>">
  <?php echo $page->author; ?>
</a>
~~~

Or:

~~~ .php
<?php echo $page->author; ?>
~~~
